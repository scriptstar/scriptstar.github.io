Currently, I am using this theme for my technology blog and as well as my personal blog as a digital diary.

I crafted this for my own use with a lot of care and love. It has a very distinctive minimal landing page with links to the blog and other pages. I incorporated comments system using Disqus, Google Analytics, and social sharing buttons that don't make loads of HTTP requests. 

I am obsessed with site loading speeds means I optimised this theme to load with a breakneck speed which helps to surge your rankings to the top of any modern search engine without lifting your finger.
